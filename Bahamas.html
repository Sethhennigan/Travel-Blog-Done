                    <h3>Pig Island</h3>
                    <p>Pig Beach located in Grand bahamas (also known as Major Cay) is a beach on an uninhabited island (or cay) located in Exuma, the Bahamas. The island takes its unofficial name from the fact that it is populated by a colony of feral pigs which live on the island. It has become a tourist attraction in modern times.
                        The pigs are known in popular culture as "the swimming pigs" although other islands with swimming pigs exist in the Bahamas..
